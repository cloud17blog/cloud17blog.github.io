## About Me

I've been working in IT for over 20 years and have experience in a wide range of technologies and roles. I started out in software development, but later roles have required me to become familiar with system architecture and design, systems administration (including SQL, Windows Server, Office 365 and various security products), network engineering and IT management.

I've worked in a number of industries, including retail, finance and healthcare, and have experience in both the public and private sectors.

At present I'm working as a Senior Cloud Engineer, specialising in Azure, and have experience in a wide range of cloud technologies and the associated tooling, including Azure DevOps, Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure AD / Entra ID, Landing Zones, Defender & Sentinel, and a number of scripting languages and automation tools.

I've always been interested in technology and using it as a creative medium, though only turned it into a career by accident when I realised my earlier dreams of becoming an architect (buildings, not IT!) or astronomer were not going to happen!
